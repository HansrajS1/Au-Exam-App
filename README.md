## 📱 Building APK Locally

### Option 1: Android Studio

1. Run `npx expo prebuild`
2. Open `android/` folder in Android Studio
3. Go to **Build > Build APK(s)**
4. Find APK at `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`

### Option 2: CLI

```bash
npx expo prebuild
cd android
./gradlew clean
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

Install on device:

```bash
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

---

##  Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file:

```env
APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.example.io/v1
APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
```

Use `react-native-dotenv` to load them.

##  Folder Structure

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

- **White placeholder text in APK**  
  → Set `placeholderTextColor="#000"` explicitly

- **Hermes crash on APK boot**  
  → Guard `segment[0]` and context access in `RouterGuard`

- **Appwrite auth warning**  
  → Ensure `AuthProvider` wraps layout in `_layout.tsx`

- **EAS build fails**  
  → Use `./gradlew assembleRelease` locally instead

- **Stretched or blurry icon**  
  → Use 1024×1024 PNG, square, no text, and define adaptive icon in `app.json`
